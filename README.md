# HDB Pricing Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing the pricing of Housing and Development Board (HDB) flats in Singapore. The goal is to uncover patterns, trends, and factors that influence HDB flat prices using various data science and machine learning techniques.

## Project Objectives

- **Understand Key Factors:** Identify and analyze the key factors that influence HDB flat prices.
- **Data Analysis:** Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and correlations.
- **Model Development:** Develop predictive models to estimate HDB prices based on selected features.
- **Insights:** Provide actionable insights that could be used for future pricing strategies or market analysis.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection:** 
   - HDB resale transaction data is sourced from public datasets or APIs.
   - Relevant features include flat type, location, floor area, lease commencement date, and more.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Cleaning and transforming the data to handle missing values, categorical variables, and outliers.
   - Feature engineering to create new variables that may influence the pricing model.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualizing distributions, trends, and correlations among features.
   - Identifying key factors that affect pricing, such as location, flat type, and remaining lease.

4. **Modeling:**
   - Multiple machine learning models are tested, such as linear regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods.
   - Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation are employed to optimize model performance.
   - The best-performing model is selected based on evaluation metrics like RMSE, MAE, or R-squared.

5. **Results and Insights:**
   - Summarizing the findings from the EDA and model outcomes.
   - Discussing the most significant predictors of HDB flat prices.
   - Providing potential recommendations or considerations for buyers, sellers, and policymakers.

## Tools and Libraries

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for data analysis and model development.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building and evaluating machine learning models.

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of HDB flat pricing, revealing important trends and factors that influence market prices. The insights gained can be valuable for various stakeholders, including potential buyers, real estate agents, and policymakers.
